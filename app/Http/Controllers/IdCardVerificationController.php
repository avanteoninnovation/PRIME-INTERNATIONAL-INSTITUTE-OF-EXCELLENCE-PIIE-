/**
 * The public landing page a scanned ID-card QR code opens. Deliberately
 * unauthenticated (a security guard or visitor scanning a physical card has
 * no PIIE login) but only reachable via a Laravel signed URL — the `signed`
 * middleware on this route rejects any request whose signature doesn't
 * match or has expired before this method ever runs, so the only way in is
 * a URL this app itself generated (see IdCard::verifyUrl()).
 *
 * Shows the minimum needed to confirm "this is a real, currently active
 * student ID" — name, photo, class/programme, school, status. Deliberately
 * does NOT show phone, blood group, or any other personal detail the card
 * itself carries: those are fine printed on physical plastic a student
 * carries, but not fine served to anyone who scans a code, unauthenticated,
 * from anywhere.
